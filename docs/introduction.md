Welcome to the Stryker for JavaScript & Friends documentation.
Stryker started out as a pure JavaScript mutation testing framework, that's why it simply referred to as **Stryker**.

Today, Stryker supports most JavaScript projects.
It includes support for TypeScript, React, Angular, VueJS and NodeJS.

Don't hesitate to get started using our [getting started](./getting-started.md) guide.
