Install Stryker using [npm](https://nodejs.org).

## 1 Prepare

Make sure you have npm and nodejs installed. Open a terminal / command prompt and cd to the root of your project you want to mutation test.

```bash
cd my-project
```

---

## 2 Install

The easiest way to get started with Stryker is by installing the stryker-cli globally.
It is a small package which forwards commands to your local Stryker instance.

```bash
npm install -g stryker-cli
```

Optionally, you could also install Stryker directly yourself.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @stryker-mutator/core
```

If you choose to not install the stryker-cli, use `npx stryker` (after installing `@stryker-mutator/core` locally) instead of `stryker` for the rest of the quickstart.

---

## 3 Configure

Run this command to configure Stryker.

```bash
stryker init
```

If you're asked to install Stryker, choose **Yes**. Follow the questionnaire.

Please let us know if your option is missing here [by opening an issue](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js/issues/new).

After the init is done, inspect the `stryker.conf.js` file.

For more information on what these options mean, take a look at the [Stryker readme](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js/tree/master/packages/core#readme)

```bash
