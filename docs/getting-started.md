## 1 Prepare

Make sure you have npm and nodejs installed. Open a terminal / command prompt and cd to the root of your project you want to mutation test.

```bash
cd my-project
```

---

## 2 Install

The easiest way to get started with Stryker is by using the `npm init stryker` command.

```bash
npm init stryker
```

This command will first install Stryker and then run the Stryker initializer. During the initialization, you'll be asked a series of questions to help set up Stryker for your project.

If you're asked to install Stryker, choose **Yes**.

After the init is done, inspect the `stryker.config.mjs` file.

For more information on what these options mean, take a look at [the Configuration docs page](./configuration.md)

## 3 Let's kill some mutants
