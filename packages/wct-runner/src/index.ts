  `The @stryker-mutator/wct-runner package is dropped in Stryker 4.0. Please see https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/issues/2386 for more details. Feel free to keep using @stryker-mutator/wct-runner@3 or start a community fork. 
  Note that [support for the web-component-tester itself is minimal](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/issues/3398), you might want to consider switching to a different test runner.
  Stryker still supports Mocha, Jest, Jasmine and Karma.`
