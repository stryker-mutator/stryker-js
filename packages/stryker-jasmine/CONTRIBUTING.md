# Contribute to Stryker

This is the contribution guide for Stryker. Great to have you here! Here are a few ways you can help make this project better.

## Learn & listen

Get in touch with us through twitter or via the [Stryker gitter](https://gitter.im/stryker-mutator/stryker)

## Adding new features

New features are welcome! Either as requests or proposals. 

1. Please create an issue first or let us know via the [Stryker gitter](https://gitter.im/stryker-mutator/stryker)
2. Create a fork on your github account.
3. When writing your code, please conform to the existing coding style.
   See [.editorconfig](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker/blob/master/.editorconfig) and the [typescript guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)
4. Please create or edit unit tests or integration tests.
5. Run the tests using `npm test`
6. When creating commits, please conform to [the angular commit message style](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk04jEuGfk9kYzfqCuOlPTSJw3hEDZJTBN5E5f1SALo/edit).
   Namely in the form `<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n[body]`
   * Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore.
   * Scope can be the file or group of files (not a strict right or wrong)
   * Subject and body: present tense (~changed~*change*, ~added~*add*) and include motivation and contrasts with previous behaviour
  

Don't get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around a day or so.
