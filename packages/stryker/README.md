# Stryker
*Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.*  
*William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.*

## Introduction
For an introduction to mutation testing and Stryker's features, see [stryker-mutator.github.io](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/).

## Getting started
Stryker is a mutation testing framework for JavaScript. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs.

To install Stryker, execute the command:
```sh
$ npm install stryker stryker-api --save-dev
```

***Note:*** *During installation you may run into errors caused by [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp). It is safe to ignore them.*

To test if Stryker is installed correctly, execute the command:
```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/stryker --version
```

This should print the latest version of Stryker.

## Usage

```sh
$ node_modules/.bin/stryker <command> [options] [stryker.conf.js]
```

The main `command` for Stryker is `run`, which kicks off mutation testing.

By default, we expect a `stryker.conf.js` file in the current working directory. This can be overridden by specifying a different file as the last parameter.

Before your first run, we recommend you try the `init` command, which helps you to set up this `stryker.conf.js` file and install any missing packages needed for your specific configuration. We recommend you verify the contents of the configuration file after this initialization, to make sure everything is setup correctly. Of course, you can still make changes to it, before you run Stryker for the first time.

The following is an example `stryker.conf.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = function(config){
  config.set({
    files: ['test/helpers/**/*.js', 
            'test/unit/**/*.js', 
            { pattern: 'src/**/*.js', included: false, mutated: true }
            { pattern: 'src/templates/*.html', included: false, mutated: false }
            '!src/fileToIgnore.js'],
    testFramework: 'mocha',
    testRunner: 'mocha',
    reporter: ['progress', 'clear-text', 'dots', 'html', 'event-recorder'],
    coverageAnalysis: 'perTest',
    plugins: ['stryker-mocha-runner', 'stryker-html-reporter']
  });
}
```

As you can see, the config file is *not* a simple JSON file. It should be a common js (a.k.a. node) module. You might recognize this way of working from the karma test runner.

Make sure you *at least* specify the `files` and the `testRunner` options when mixing the config file and/or command line options.

## Command-line interface
Stryker can also be installed, configured and run using the [Stryker-CLI](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-cli). If you plan on using Stryker in more projects, the Stryker-CLI is the easiest way to install, configure and run Stryker for your project.

You can install the Stryker-CLI using:

```
$ npm install -g stryker-cli
```

The Stryker-CLI works by passing received commands to your local Stryker installation. If you don't have Stryker installed yet, the Stryker-CLI will help you with your Stryker installation. This method allows us to provide additional commands with updates of Stryker itself.

## Supported mutators  
See our website for the [list of currently supported mutators](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/mutators.html).

## Configuration  
All configuration options can either be set via the command line or via the `stryker.conf.js` config file.

`files` and `mutate` both support globbing expressions using [node glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob).
This is the same globbing format you might know from [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) or [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma).  
You can *ignore* files by adding an exclamation mark (`!`) at the start of an expression.

#### Files required to run your tests  
**Command line:** `[--files|-f] node_modules/a-lib/**/*.js,src/**/*.js,a.js,test/**/*.js`  
**Config file:** `files: ['{ pattern: 'src/**/*.js', mutated: true }, '!src/**/index.js', 'test/**/*.js']`  
**Default value:** *none*  
**Mandatory**: yes  
**Description:**  
With `files` you specify all files needed to run your tests. If the test runner you use already provides the test framework (Jasmine, Mocha, etc.),
you should *not* include those files here as well.  
The files will be loaded in the order in which they are specified. Files that you want to ignore should be mentioned last.

When using the command line, the list can only contain a comma separated list of globbing expressions.  
When using the config file you can provide an array with `string`s or `InputFileDescriptor` objects, like so:  

* `string`: The globbing expression used for selecting the files needed to run the tests.  
* `InputFileDescriptor` object: `{ pattern: 'pattern', included: true, mutated: false }`:  
   * The `pattern` property is mandatory and contains the globbing expression used for selecting the files. Using `!` to ignore files is *not* supported here.  
   * The `included` property is optional and determines whether or not this file should be loaded initially by the test-runner (default: true). With `included: false` the files will be copied to the sandbox during testing, but they wont be explicitly loaded by the test runner. Two usecases for `included: false` are for HTML files and for source files when your tests `require()` them.
   * The `mutated` property is optional and determines whether or not this file should be targeted for mutations (default: false)  

*Note*: To include a file/folder which start with an exclamation mark (`!`), use the `InputFileDescriptor` syntax.  

#### Source code files to mutate  
**Command line:** `[--mutate|-m] src/**/*.js,a.js`
**Config file:** `mutate: ['src/**/*.js', 'a.js']`  
**Default value:** *none*  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
With `mutate` you configure the subset of files to use for mutation testing. Generally speaking, these should be your own source files.  
This is optional, as you can also use the `mutated` property with the `files` parameter or not mutate any files at all to perform a dry-run (test-run).  
We expect a comma separated list of globbing expressions, which will be used to select the files to be mutated.

#### Test runner  
**Command line:** `--testRunner karma`  
**Config file:** `testRunner: 'karma'`  
**Default value:** *none*  
**Mandatory**: yes  
**Description:**  
With `testRunner` you specify the test runner to run your tests. This option is required.  
Make sure the test runner plugin for Stryker is installed. E.g. we need the `stryker-karma-runner` to use `karma` as a test runner. 
See the [list of plugins](http://stryker-mutator.github.io/plugins.html) for an up-to-date list of supported test runners and plugins.

#### Test framework  
**Command line:** `--testFramework jasmine`  
**Config file:** `testFramework: 'jasmine'`  
**Default value:** *none*  
**Mandatory**: yes  
**Description:**  
With `testFramework` you configure which test framework your tests are using. This value is directly consumed by the test runner and therefore
depends what framework that specific test runner supports. By default, this value is also used for `testFramework`.  

#### Type of coverage analysis  
**Full notation:** `--coverageAnalysis perTest`  
**Config file key:** `coverageAnalysis: 'perTest'`  
**Default value:** `perTest`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
With `coverageAnalysis` you specify which coverage analysis strategy you want to use.  
Stryker can analyse code coverage results. This can potentially speed up mutation testing a lot, as only the tests covering a 
particular mutation are tested for each mutant. 
This does *not* influence the resulting mutation testing score. It only improves performance, so we enable it by default.

The possible values are: 
* **off**: Stryker will not determine the code covered by tests during the initial test run phase. All tests will be executed for each mutant 
during the mutation testing phase.

* **all**: Stryker will determine the code covered by all tests during the initial test run phase. Only mutants actually covered by your 
test suite are tested during the mutation testing phase. This setting requires your test runner to be able to report the code coverage back to Stryker. 
Currently, only the `stryker-mocha-runner` and the `stryker-karma-runner` do this.  

* **perTest**: Stryker will determine the code covered by your test per executed test during the initial test run phase. Only mutants actually covered by your 
test suite are tested during the mutation testing phase. 
Only the tests that cover a particular mutant are tested for each one. This requires your tests to be able to run independently of each other and in random order. 
In addition to requiring your test runner to be able to report the code coverage back to Stryker, your chosen `testFramework` also needs to support running code
 before and after each test, as well as test filtering.  
 Currently, `stryker-mocha-runner` as well as `stryker-karma-runner` support this. However, `stryker-karma-runner` support is limited to using it with `Jasmine` as the test framework 
 (`Mocha` is not yet supported).

#### Reporters  
**Command line:** `--reporter clear-text,progress,dots`  
**Config file:** `reporter: ['clear-text', 'progress', 'dots']`     
**Default value:** `['clear-text', 'progress']`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
With `reporter` you can set a reporter or group of reporters for stryker to use.
These reporters can be used out of the box: `clear-text`, `progress` and `event-recorder`.
By default `clear-text` and `progress` are active if no reporter is configured.
You can load additional plugins to get more reporters. See [stryker-mutator.github.io](http://stryker-mutator.github.io)
for an up-to-date list of supported reporter plugins and a description on each reporter.

The `clear-text` reporter supports an additional config option to show more tests that were executed to kill a mutant. The config for your config file is: `clearTextReporter: { maxTestsToLog: 3 },`
  
#### Plugins  
**Command line:** `--plugins stryker-html-reporter,stryker-karma-runner`  
**Config file:** `plugins: ['stryker-html-reporter', 'stryker-karma-runner']`  
**Default value:** `['stryker-*']`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
With `plugins` you can add additional Node modules for Stryker to load (or `require`).
By default, all `node_modules` starting with `stryker-` will be loaded, so you would normally not need to specify this option.
These modules should be installed right next to stryker. For a current list of plugins,
you can consult [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40stryker-plugin) or 
[stryker-mutator.github.io](http://stryker-mutator.github.io).

#### Start of port range for test runners
**Command line:** `--port 9234`  
**Config file:** `port: 9234`    
**Default value:** `9234`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
With `port` you specify the first port to pass on to the test runner to use. Any additional test runners will be spawned using ports n+1, n+2, etc.
For example, when you set to use port 9234 and Stryker decides to start four test runner processes, ports 9234, 9235, 9236 and 9237 will be passed to the test runner.  
If the test runner decides to use the port it should be available for use.

#### Global timeout in milliseconds  
**Command line:** `--timeoutMs 5000`  
**Config file:** `timeoutMs: 5000`  
**Default value:** `5000`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
When Stryker is mutating code, it cannot determine indefinitely whether or not a code mutation results in an infinite loop (see [Halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)).
In order to battle infinite loops, a test run gets killed after a certain period. This period is configurable with two settings: `timeoutMs` and `timeoutFactor`. 
To calculate the actual timeout in milliseconds the, following formula is used:

```
timeoutForTestRunMs = timeOfTheInitialTestRunMs * timeoutFactor + timeoutMs
``` 

With `timeoutFactor` you can configure the allowed deviation relative to the time of a normal test run. Tweak this if you notice that mutants are prone to creating slower code, but not infinite loops.
`timeoutMs` let's you configure an absolute deviation. Use it, if you run Stryker on a busy machine and you need to wait longer to make sure that the code indeed entered an infinite loop.  

#### Timeout factor  
**Command line:** `--timeoutFactor 1.5`  
**Config file:** `timeoutFactor: 1.5`  
**Default value:** `1.5`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
See [Timeout in milliseconds](#Timeout-in-milliseconds).

#### Number of maximum concurrent test runners  
**Command line:** `--maxConcurrentTestRunners 3`  
**Config file:** `maxConcurrentTestRunners: 3`  
**Default value:** number of CPU cores
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description:**  
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent test runners to spawn.  
Mutation testing is time consuming. By default Stryker tries to make the most of your CPU, by spawning as many test runners as you have CPU cores.  
This setting allows you to override this default behavior.

Reasons you might want to lower this setting:

* Your test runner starts a browser (another CPU-intensive process)
* You're running on a shared server and/or
* Your hard disk cannot handle the I/O of all test runners

#### Thresholds for mutation score  
**Config file:** `thresholds: { high: 80, low: 60, break: null }`  
**Default value:** `{ high: 80, low: 60, break: null }`  
**Mandatory**: no  
**Description**  
Specify the thresholds for mutation score. 

* `mutation score >= high`: Awesome! Reporters should color this green and happy.
* `high > mutation score >= low`: Warning! Reporters should color this orange/yellow. Watch yourself!
* `mutation score < low`: Danger! Reporters should color this in red. You're in danger!
* `mutation score < break`: Error! Stryker will exit with exit code 1, indicating a build failure. No consequence for reporters, though.

It is not allowed to only supply one value. However, `high` and `low` values can be the same, making sure colors are either red or green. 
Set `break` to `null` (default) to never let the process crash.

#### Log level  
**Command line:** `--logLevel info`    
**Config file:** `logLevel: 'info'`
**Default value:** `info`  
**Mandatory**: no 
**Description:**  
 Set the `log4js` log level that Stryker uses (default is `info`). Possible values: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `all` and `off`.  
 *Note*: Test runners are run as child processes of the Stryker Node process. All output (stdout) of the `testRunner` is logged as `trace`.  
 Thus, to see logging output from the test runner set the `logLevel` to `all` or `trace`.
