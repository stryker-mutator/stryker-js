# Stryker

*Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.*  
*William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.*

Welcome to Stryker's monorepo. This is where all official stryker packages are maintained.
If you're new to monorepos: don't be scared. You'll find the packages in the `packages` folder.

If you're interested in why we chose a monorepo, please read [babeljs's design document about monorepos](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md). We use it for the same reasons as they do.
